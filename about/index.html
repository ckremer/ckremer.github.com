	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <p>I study the ways sand and mud move through giant channels in the deep ocean.
	  These channels can be wider, longer, and deeper than the Grand Canyon, 
	  and I want to know why they form and how they change over time. 
	  Enormous, roiling clouds of mud, sand, and gravel travel down the courses
	  of these channels, and the sediments left behind help us unravel a history 
	  of erosion and deposition. Here are some questions I'm thinking about: How do 
	  landslides large enough to wipe out Manhattan redirect the course of other sediment 
	  flows? How do we predict where strong flows leave behind gravel and weak 
	  flows leave behind mud? The answers to these questions have major implications 
	  for the discovery of energy resources and climate change solutions. 
	  For my work, I've partnered with a European energy company to study an 
	  ancient channel system that once flowed at the foot of the Alps.Â </p>
